			<h1>Kieft, Maura </h1>
			<p>Three Interesting facts about myself are that I play ice hockey, have a twin brother, Liam, and I have been to over 300 concerts! I am studying Computer Science because when I originally came to college I was undecided with no idea what I truly wanted to study, but with a passion for learning. After taking my first programming course I fell in love with the computer science field and its ability to test my mental strength. I think I decided to study computer science because it pushed me significantly more than any other classes I had taken in different majors.
